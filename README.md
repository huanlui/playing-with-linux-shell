# playing-with-linux-shell
A set of .sh files showing some linux shell commands. Just to practice. 

It consists on a set of files showing basic usage of Linux shell.

These files are being generated by using command "script" and can be replayed when you want. To generate this scripts, I have created some utility functions. They are not scrictly necessary, but they can help. If you want to used it, please copy the below lines to your .zshrc, .bashrc or equivalent:

# Script utils (@huanlui)
# ========================

# rses stands for Record Session. Records session to file passed as parameter (filename).
# Additionally, creates a filename.timing in order to replay script with original timings
function rses()
{
	if [ $# -eq 0 ];  then
		echo "Usage: rses sessionmame"
	else
		script $1 --timing=$1.timing		
	fi
}

# eses stands for Exit Session. Just an alias for exit to keep naming coherence.
alias eses="exit"

# pses stands for Play Session. Plays session withstored in file passed as parameter (filename) using file.timing for timing. 
function pses()
{
	if [ $# -eq 0 ];  then
		echo "Usage: pses sessionmame"
	else
		scriptreplay --timing=$1.timing $1		
	fi
}

# rmses stands for Remove Session. Removes sessionname and sessionname.timing files
function rmses()
{
	if [ $# -eq 0 ];  then
		echo "Usage: rmses sessionmame"
	else
		rm -f $1 $1.timing
	fi
}


# wses stands for Watch Session. Watchs sessionname file. Equivalent to cat sessionname
function wses()
{
	if [ $# -eq 0 ];  then
		echo "Usage: wses sessionmame"
	else
		cat $1
	fi
}
